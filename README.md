# Pi Pico Demo Blinking Led Using Modern Cpp

In this demo of a blinking LED, we can probe and see how Modern CPP can be used to write code for the Raspberry Pico.
The result is as simple as getting the Picoâ€™s onboard (GPIO 25) LED blinking. 
No additional hardware is needed then.

To debug the code (there might be better techniques) I used the serial (USB mode) printing methods that the C/C++ SDK API provides, so it should be easy to connect and see the output using any serial terminal in your PC.

## This code includes:
* Encapsulation (A Led Class)
* Abstractions (Qualifiers)
* RAII by using a unique pointer
* The main file has .cpp extension 
* Sending messages to the terminal through cout (it is also possible using puts and some other methods provided by the SDK)
* It is a multi file project

## Building the code
I used a Windows system while working on this project so the CMake command to build it are the following:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
nmake
```
In case you need information of how to build it on Mac and Linux I strongly recommend the [Getting Started Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) provided by Raspberry. It is a well-documented way to go with.

# Schematic
You don't really need any additional hardware but just in case you want to add a reset button to avoid being connecting and disconnecting every time you need to program the board here is an image that can be helpful.

# Serial Output
This is what you will see on a serial terminal (TeraTerm, Putty, CoolTer, RealTerm, and so on).
